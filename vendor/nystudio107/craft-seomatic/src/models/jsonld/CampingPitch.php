/**
 * CampingPitch - A CampingPitch is an individual place for overnight stay in
 * the outdoors, typically being part of a larger camping site, or Campground.
 * In British English a campsite, or campground, is an area, usually divided
 * into a number of pitches, where people can camp overnight using tents or
 * camper vans or caravans; this British English use of the word is synonymous
 * with the American English expression campground. In American English the
 * term campsite generally means an area where an individual, family, group,
 * or military unit can pitch a tent or park a camper; a campground may
 * contain many campsites. (Source: Wikipedia see
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campsite). See also the dedicated document on
 * the use of schema.org for marking up hotels and other forms of
 * accommodations.
