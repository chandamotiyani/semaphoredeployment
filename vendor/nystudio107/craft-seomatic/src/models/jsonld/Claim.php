/**
 * Claim - A Claim in Schema.org represents a specific, factually-oriented
 * claim that could be the itemReviewed in a ClaimReview. The content of a
 * claim can be summarized with the text property. Variations on well known
 * claims can have their common identity indicated via sameAs links, and
 * summarized with a name. Ideally, a Claim description includes enough
 * contextual information to minimize the risk of ambiguity or inclarity. In
 * practice, many claims are better understood in the context in which they
 * appear or the interpretations provided by claim reviews. Beyond
 * ClaimReview, the Claim type can be associated with related creative works -
 * for example a ScholaryArticle or Question might be about some Claim. At
 * this time, Schema.org does not define any types of relationship between
 * claims. This is a natural area for future exploration.
