 * CriticReview - A CriticReview is a more specialized form of Review written

 * more in-depth and professionally written. For simpler, casually written
 * user/visitor/viewer/customer reviews, it is more appropriate to use the
 * UserReview type. Review aggregator sites such as Metacritic already
 * separate out the site's user reviews from selected critic reviews that
 * originate from third-party sources.
