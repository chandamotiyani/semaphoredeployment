/**
 * Grant - A grant, typically financial or otherwise quantifiable, of
 * resources. Typically a funder sponsors some MonetaryAmount to an
 * Organization or Person, sometimes not necessarily via a dedicated or
 * long-lived Project, resulting in one or more outputs, or fundedItems. For
 * financial sponsorship, indicate the funder of a MonetaryGrant. For
 * non-financial support, indicate sponsor of Grants of resources (e.g. office
 * space). Grants support activities directed towards some agreed collective
 * goals, often but not always organized as Projects. Long-lived projects are
 * sometimes sponsored by a variety of grants over time, but it is also common
 * for a project to be associated with a single grant. The amount of a Grant
 * is represented using amount as a MonetaryAmount.
