Use businessFunction to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a Demand. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer. Inverse property: itemOffered.',
        'position' => 'The position of an item in a series or sequence of items.',
        'producer' => 'The person or organization who produced the work (e.g. music album, movie, tv/radio series etc.).',
        'provider' => 'The service provider, service operator, or service performer; the goods producer. Another party (a seller) may offer those services or goods on behalf of the provider. A provider may also serve as the seller. Supersedes carrier.',

        'publisher' => 'The publisher of the creative work.',
        'publisherImprint' => 'The publishing division which published the comic.',
        'publishingPrinciples' => 'The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via URL) a document describing the editorial principles of an Organization (or individual e.g. a Person writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a CreativeWork (e.g. NewsArticle) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the CreativeWork. While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a funder) can be expressed using schema.org terminology.',
        'recordedAt' => 'The Event where the CreativeWork was recorded. The CreativeWork may capture all or part of the event. Inverse property: recordedIn.',

        'sdDatePublished' => 'Indicates the date on which the current structured data was generated / published. Typically used alongside sdPublisher',
        'sdLicense' => 'A license document that applies to this structured data, typically indicated by URL.',
        'sdPublisher' => 'Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived automatically from existing published content but published on a different site.

        'sourceOrganization' => 'The Organization on whose behalf the creator was working.',
        'spatial' => 'The "spatial" property can be used in cases when more specific properties (e.g. locationCreated, spatialCoverage, contentLocation) are not known to be appropriate.',
        'spatialCoverage' => 'The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York.',
        'sponsor' => 'A person or organization that supports a thing through a pledge, promise, or financial contribution. e.g. a sponsor of a Medical Study or a corporate sponsor of an event.',
        'temporal' => 'The "temporal" property can be used in cases where more specific properties (e.g. temporalCoverage, dateCreated, dateModified, datePublished) are not known to be appropriate.',
        'temporalCoverage' => 'The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format. In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written "2011/2012"). Other forms of content e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via "1939/1945". Open-ended date ranges can be written with ".." in place of the end date. For example, "2015-11/.." indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. Supersedes datasetTimeInterval.',

        'typicalAgeRange' => 'The typical expected age range, e.g. \'7-9\', \'11-\'.',
        'usageInfo' => 'The schema.org usageInfo property indicates further information about a CreativeWork. This property is applicable both to works that are freely available and to those that require payment or other transactions. It can reference additional information e.g. community expectations on preferred linking and citation conventions, as well as purchasing details. For something that can be commercially licensed, usageInfo can provide detailed, resource-specific information about licensing options. This property can be used alongside the license property which indicates license(s) applicable to some piece of content. The usageInfo property can provide information about other licensing options, e.g. acquiring commercial usage rights for an image that is also available under non-commercial creative commons licenses.',
        'version' => 'The version of the CreativeWork embodied by a specified resource.',
        'video' => 'An embedded video object.',

        'workTranslation' => 'A work that is a translation of the content of this work. e.g. 西遊記 has an English workTranslation “Journey to the West”,a German workTranslation “Monkeys Pilgerfahrt” and a Vietnamese translation Tây du ký bình khảo. Inverse property: translationOfWork.'
