/**
 * ReportageNewsArticle - The ReportageNewsArticle type is a subtype of
 * NewsArticle representing news articles which are the result of journalistic
 * news reporting conventions. In practice many news publishers produce a wide
 * variety of article types, many of which might be considered a NewsArticle
 * but not a ReportageNewsArticle. For example, opinion pieces, reviews,
 * analysis, sponsored or satirical articles, or articles that combine several
 * of these elements. The ReportageNewsArticle type is based on a stricter
 * ideal for "news" as a work of journalism, with articles based on factual
 * information either observed or verified by the author, or reported and
 * verified from knowledgeable sources. This often includes perspectives from
 * multiple viewpoints on a particular issue (distinguishing news reports from
 * public relations or propaganda). News reports in the ReportageNewsArticle
 * sense de-emphasize the opinion of the author, with commentary and value
 * judgements typically expressed elsewhere. A ReportageNewsArticle which goes
 * deeper into analysis can also be marked with an additional type of
 * AnalysisNewsArticle.
