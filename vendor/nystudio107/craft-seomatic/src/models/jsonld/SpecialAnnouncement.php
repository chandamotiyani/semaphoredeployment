/**
 * SpecialAnnouncement - A SpecialAnnouncement combines a simple date-stamped
 * textual information update with contextualized Web links and other
 * structured data. It represents an information update made by a
 * locally-oriented organization, for example schools, pharmacies, healthcare
 * providers, community groups, police, local government. For work in progress
 * guidelines on Coronavirus-related markup see this doc. The motivating
 * scenario for SpecialAnnouncement is the Coronavirus pandemic, and the
 * initial vocabulary is oriented to this urgent situation. Schema.org expect
 * to improve the markup iteratively as it is deployed and as feedback emerges
 * from use. In addition to our usual Github entry, feedback comments can also
 * be provided in this document. While this schema is designed to communicate
 * urgent crisis-related information, it is not the same as an emergency
 * warning technology like CAP, although there may be overlaps. The intent is
 * to cover the kinds of everyday practical information being posted to
 * existing websites during an emergency situation. Several kinds of
 * information can be provided: We encourage the provision of "name", "text",
 * "datePosted", "expires" (if appropriate), "category" and "url" as a simple
 * baseline. It is important to provide a value for "category" where possible,
 * most ideally as a well known URL from Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of
 * the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, this should be
 * "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic"
 * or "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910". For many of the possible
 * properties, values can either be simple links or an inline description,
 * depending on whether a summary is available. For a link, provide just the
 * URL of the appropriate page as the property's value. For an inline
 * description, use a WebContent type, and provide the url as a property of
 * that, alongside at least a simple "text" summary of the page. It is
 * unlikely that a single SpecialAnnouncement will need all of the possible
 * properties simultaneously. We expect that in many cases the page referenced
 * might contain more specialized structured data, e.g. contact info,
 * openingHours, Event, FAQPage etc. By linking to those pages from a
 * SpecialAnnouncement you can help make it clearer that the events are
 * related to the situation (e.g. Coronavirus) indicated by the category
 * property of the SpecialAnnouncement. Many SpecialAnnouncements will relate
 * to particular regions and to identifiable local organizations. Use
 * spatialCoverage for the region, and announcementLocation to indicate
 * specific LocalBusinesses and CivicStructures. If the announcement affects
 * both a particular region and a specific location (for example, a library
 * closure that serves an entire region), use both spatialCoverage and
 * announcementLocation. The about property can be used to indicate entities
 * that are the focus of the announcement. We now recommend using about only
 * for representing non-location entities (e.g. a Course or a RadioStation).
 * For places, use announcementLocation and spatialCoverage. Consumers of this
 * markup should be aware that the initial design encouraged the use of /about
 * for locations too. The basic content of SpecialAnnouncement is similar to
 * that of an RSS or Atom feed. For publishers without such feeds, basic
 * feed-like information can be shared by posting SpecialAnnouncement updates
 * in a page, e.g. using JSON-LD. For sites with Atom/RSS functionality, you
 * can point to a feed with the webFeed property. This can be a simple URL, or
 * an inline DataFeed object, with encodingFormat providing media type
 * information e.g. "application/rss+xml" or "application/atom+xml".
