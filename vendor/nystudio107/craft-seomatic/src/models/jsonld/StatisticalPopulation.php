/**
 * StatisticalPopulation - A StatisticalPopulation is a set of instances of a
 * certain given type that satisfy some set of constraints. The property
 * populationType is used to specify the type. Any property that can be used
 * on instances of that type can appear on the statistical population. For
 * example, a StatisticalPopulation representing all Persons with a
 * homeLocation of East Podunk California, would be described by applying the
 * appropriate homeLocation and populationType properties to a
 * StatisticalPopulation item that stands for that set of people. The
 * properties numConstraints and constrainingProperties are used to specify
 * which of the populations properties are used to specify the population.
 * Note that the sense of "population" used here is the general sense of a
 * statistical population, and does not imply that the population consists of
 * people. For example, a populationType of Event or NewsArticle could be
 * used. See also Observation, and the data and datasets overview for more
 * details.
