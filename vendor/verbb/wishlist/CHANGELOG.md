## 1.4.2 - 2020-12-16

### Added
- When performing any list or item actions from the front end, a flash error/notice is now available with the result. Use `craft.app.session.getFlash('notice')` to output this message when using the `url()` methods or using a `<form>` POST submit.
- When submitting a form for managing items, you can see a `successMessage` or `failMessage` to modify the flash message returned. This is not available when using the `url()` methods. Be sure to hash the message: `<input type="hidden" name="successMessage" value="{{ 'Override Message' | hash }}">`.

## 1.4.1 - 2020-12-07

### Changed
- Wishlist queries via GraphQL are now no longer automatically included in the public schema.

## 1.4.0 - 2020-11-10

> {warning} Please note the change in behaviour for `craft.wishlist.item()` has meant that you cannot rely on lists being auto-created anymore on page-load. Ensure anywhere you call `{% set list = craft.wishlist.lists().one() %}` you check `{% if list %}` before doing anything on the list. Ensure your templates work correctly.

### Added
- Add params to `addUrl()`, `removeUrl()` and `toggleUrl()` to make it easier to create URLs.
- Add listType handle to `craft.wishlist.item()`.
- Add `listTypeId` query param to Item queries.

### Changed
- `craft.wishlist.item()` no longer automatically creates new lists when the page is loaded, preventing lots of lists being created for guests. Previously as soon as the page loaded with this call, a list would be created for users, meaning lists could get out of control easily. Be sure to double check your templates.
