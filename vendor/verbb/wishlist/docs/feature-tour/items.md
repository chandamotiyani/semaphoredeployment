# Items

Items are what's added to your list, and are really just elements. These include (but not limited to) Entries, Categories, Commerce Products/Variants and more. You can also store additional information with your items via custom fields, through your [List Type](docs:feature-tour/lists).

Look at the [Item](docs:developers/item) for what you can do with an Item.
